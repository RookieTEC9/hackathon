        <p>AtomHacks is a 12-hour long event where students of different skill levels come together to create software and hardware projects from scratch.</p>
        <p>You don't need to be a professional hacker, or even have any programming experience at all! Along with introductory workshops the day before, we'll have on-site mentors who will be able to help you out with any issues you run into.</p>

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
          <p>A hackathon is a short event focused on creating projects that typically have something to do with computer engineering or computer science. Aside from the amazing experience, they are often viewed as learning events, as you can take a lot away from attending one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>Who can attend?</h3>
          <p>Students who are currently enrolled at Bronx Science are allowed to attend the hackathon. If you are an alumni or a graduate of another high school and are interested in helping out, feel free to contact us about mentorship!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>When is AtomHacks?</h3>
          <p>AtomHacks will span over 2 days as it did last year. We will be holding introductory workshops after school on Friday, April 8, with the actual hackathon taking place on Saturday, April 9.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>Can I start working before the hackathon?</h3>
          <p>To keep the competition fair, all code used in your project must be written at the hackathon. However, you are allowed to start brainstorming your project before the event begins.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>How large can my team be?</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>What can I create?</h3>
          <p>You can create anything you want, as long as your hack does not violate the <a href="./conduct.pdf" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>.</p>
        </div>
